# A Novel Graph-Based Approach to Identify Opinion Leaders in Twitter

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper **"A Novel Graph-Based Approach to Identify Opinion Leaders in Twitter."** The paper presents a methodology for detecting influential users on Twitter using graph analysis techniques. Our approach focuses on identifying opinion leaders based on their influence during specific timeframes, independent of when their tweets were originally generated.

## Overview

In our study, we aimed to understand the dynamics and influential actors on Twitter by leveraging graph-based methods. By analyzing the network structure and interactions, we identified key opinion leaders whose influence is significant within a given month. This repository includes the scripts and tools necessary to reproduce our results and apply the methodology to other datasets.

## Features

- **Graph Construction:** Tools to construct interaction graphs from Twitter data.
- **Influence Analysis:** Algorithms to identify and rank opinion leaders based on their influence within specific timeframes.
- **Psycho-Linguistics Analysis:** Code to perform Psycho-Linguistics Analysis using opinion leader's tweets.
- **Data Handling:** Scripts for preprocessing and handling Twitter data.
- **Visualization:** Functions to visualize the interaction graphs and the identified opinion leaders.
